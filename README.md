old ms tools
============

This repository contains some tools from the original itsutils package.

itsutils mostly contained tools for managing windows-ce devices, but also some tools which are useful on windows by itself:

 - postmsg, tool which can send arbitrary window messages.
 - memdump, tool which can be used to inspect memory of arbitrary processes
 - setmem, tool which can modify memory for arbitrary processes.
 - regutl, tool for converting .hv registry files.
 - sdread, tool for reading and writing flashdrives.
